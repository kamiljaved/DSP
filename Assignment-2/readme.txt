The 'lab2.m' file, upon running, will record a new 15 second audio, and use it for plots and processing.

The "lab2_use_orig.m" file has been slightly modified, so that it won't record a new audio (or generate new .wav file), 
but will used the included "lab2_orig.wav" file (audio recorded for assignment report).
